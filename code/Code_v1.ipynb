In other words, I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty convoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the naturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains. Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\\'t it?  Well, I am sure there are plenty of \"scientific\" creationist \"rebuttals\" out there somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.
