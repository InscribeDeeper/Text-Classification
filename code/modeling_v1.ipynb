New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak To: National Desk, Environment Writer Contact: Erik Olson or Sarah Silver, 202-783-7800, both of the Natural Resources Defense Council WASHINGTON, April 14 -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee. The EPA list is attached. \"These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration,\" said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC. \"Water contamination isn't just a problem in Bangladesh, it's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.\" \"As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPA's list probably will be breaking the law. The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution,\" Olson continued. Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law's deadline. Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities. A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia. Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems. \"This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink. We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public,\" Olson noted. \"The time has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink.\" NRDC is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when \"A exist\" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, \"A exists\" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false. A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others. Honestly, I don't see the problem. Benedikt </td>\n",
